Apple Coding Exercise

1. Open up the src/java/AppleExercise.java in your editor of choice.
2. Follow the directions specified in the java file. Make sure to properly
   comment your code. We are looking for elegant and readable solutions.
3. For each problem, write a corresponding unit test in
   src/test/AppleExerciseTest.java.
4. If you feel like there is more than one solution to the problem,
   implement only the one that you feel is "best", and please explain
   why you think it is a better choice than the alternatives.
   List any assumptions that you made for your best solution.
5. After you have implemented your solution to each of the problems,
   you can use the included Ant build.xml file to compile your code
   and run your unit tests against your code.
6. If the build fails, you will see a message reporting the failure.
   It will specify a URI that you can open in your browser to see the
   detailed error message.
